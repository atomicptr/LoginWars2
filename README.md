# Login Wars 2

An alternative launcher for Guild Wars 2 with support for multiple accounts and some extra cheese.

## Features
* Manage multiple accounts!
* Account data can (and should) be encrypted (No more plain text password shortcuts!)
* Check your dailies, in the launcher!
* Check your latest Trading Post transactions!
* Check how much money and laurels you have on your alternative accounts without the need to log into them!

## Work in progress
* No working OS X version. I've added some code for compatibility, but [command line options aren't working on OS X.](https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/support/support/Mac-Command-line-args-not-working/first)

## How does this work?

No magic, no botting or any form of "automation". It's just a nicer, more secure and frankly better interface for your old shortcuts with command line options (e.g. -email ... -password ... -nopatchui).
