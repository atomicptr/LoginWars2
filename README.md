# Login Wars 2

An alternative launcher for Guild Wars 2 with support for multiple accounts and some extra cheese.

## Features
* Manage multiple accounts!
* Account data can (and should) be encrypted (No more plain text password shortcuts!)
* ~~Check your dailies, in the launcher!~~ (Disabled for the time being since there is no reliable way to retrieve dailies atm)
* Check your latest Trading Post transactions!
* Check how much money and laurels you have on your alternative accounts without the need to log into them!

## Work in progress
* Still no update functionality, the launcher should be able to update itself.
* No working OS X version. I've added some code for compatibility, but [command line options aren't working on OS X.](https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/support/support/Mac-Command-line-args-not-working/first)

## What it actually does

No magic, no botting or any form of "automation". It's just a nicer, more secure and frankly better interface for your old shortcuts with command line options (e.g. -email ... -password ... -nopatchui)

## FAQ

### Can I get banned for using Login Wars 2?

LoginWars2 is just calling the Gw2 executable with the [command line interface we're using for years](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Command_line_arguments). So I highly doubt that you can get banned for this. I'll contact Arena.Net at some point to confirm this.

### Why is my screen black and nothing happens?

For some odd reasons Guild Wars 2 won't tell you if your credentials are wrong (or some other kind of problem occured).

Reasons this might happen:
* Your email/password is wrong (Fix: Use the right credentials)
* You need to authenticate this system (Fix: Log in with the normal launcher once, after that it should work)

Please ArenaNet add error messages :).

### Why Login Wars >>"2"<<, is there also a "1"?

I wanted to call the app "Login Wars" but it somewhat would sound like it's for GW1 instead of GW2.
