# dynamics

An experimental alternative launcher for Guild Wars 2 with support for multiple accounts and some extra stuff, named after the College of Dynamics. Because this is Asuran technology. Name is not final...

## Features
* Manage multiple accounts
* Account data can (and should) be encrypted (No more plain text password shortcuts!)
* Check your dailies, in the launcher!
* (SOON) Check your latest Trading Post transactions (Only if you grant the permissions)
* (SOON) More cool API integrations!

## What it actually does

No magic, no botting or any form of "automation". It's just a nicer, more secure and frankly better interface for your old shortcuts with command line options (e.g. -email ... -password ... -nopatchui)

## Can I get banned for using dynamics?

dynamics is just calling the Gw2 executable with the [command line interface we're using for years](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Command_line_arguments). So I highly doubt that you can get banned for this. I'll contact Arena.Net at some point to confirm this.

## Why is my screen black and nothing happens?

For some odd reasons Guild Wars 2 won't tell you if your credentials are wrong (or some other kind of problem occured).

Reasons this might happen:
* Your email/password is wrong (Fix: Use the right credentials)
* You need to authenticate this system (Fix: Log in with the normal launcher once, after that it should work)

Please Arena.Net add error messages :).
